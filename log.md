# Project Log

## Mon 11. Mar
Had a meeting with Matteo, went well, he suggested that he might get funding for a possible phd position.

Fixed the proof of "fermats" last theorem and created the code for checking colorings of graphs.

## Tue 12. Mar
Added the previously mentioned code to the project, showed that R(3, 3, 3) = 17 for tomorrow / this evening i will be working on R(3; k) and prove a lower bound for schur numbers.

I just proved the lower bound for schur numbers later.
