\chapter{Introduction}
The following story came from Spencer (1994).
Erdős asks us to imagine an alien force, vastly more powerful than us, landing
the earth and demanding the value of 𝑟 (5, 5) or they will destroy our planet. In this
case, he claims, “we should marshall all our computers and all our mathematicians
and attempt to find the value. But suppose, instead, that they ask for 𝑟 (6, 6). In that
case, we should attempt to destroy the aliens.”
