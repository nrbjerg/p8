The subject of this project is Ramsey theory, which studies finite colorings of mathematical structures and monochromatic substructures. We focus on the areas of Ramsey theory which are related to the field of discrete mathematics, such as graph Ramsey theory and partition regularity over $\mathbb{N}^{+}$.
