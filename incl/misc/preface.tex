\chapter*{Preface}

%This is a P8 project written at the Department of Mathematical Sciences at Aalborg University.
%As such the reader is expected to have the general knowledge acquired during a bachelors degree in mathematics at Aalborg University. This project builds on my bachelors thesis \citep{bachellor} on the construction of algebraic geometry codes (AG codes), hence it is expected that the reader is familiar with the following:
%\begin{itemize}
%  \item The basic notions of linear error correcting codes.
%  \item The basics of the theory of projective, regular and absolutely irreducible curves over $\mathbb{F}_q$ and in particular the Riemann-Roch spaces associated with these curves.
%  \item The basic construction and properties of AG codes\footnote{Here we mean evaluation codes (The theory of residue codes will be introduced in Chapter \ref{chap:AG_codes})}, that is codes of the form $\mathcal{C}_L(\mathcal{X}, D, G)$ where $D$ and $G$ are divisors on the curve $\mathcal{X}$ such that the support of $D$ and $G$ is disjoint.
%\end{itemize}

The work on the project took place from the 1. of September to the 20. of December 2023.

Sources are stated at the start of each chapter, or section if the sources used in that particular section differ from the sources, which are generally used within the chapter.

Definitions, algorithms, theorems, propositions, lemmas, corollaries, examples, and remarks are numbered according to each chapter and consecutively.
Equations are also numbered according to each chapter but separately and likewise with figures and tables.
The conclusions of proofs and examples are marked with $\blacksquare$ and $\square$ respectively.

A table of notation and shorthands is given after the list of contents.
Please note that some symbols may be used differently in different chapters.

%Finally, I wish to thank and acknowledge my supervisor Matteo Bonini for his guidance and for being indulgent enough, to answer questions with no imitate application to the project.
Finally, I wish to extend a thank you to my supervisor, Matteo Bonini, for his wonderfull guidance throughout the project.
