\section{Exact Values of Small Ramsey Numbers}\label{sec:exact_values}
In this section we compute the exact values of some of the smaller ramsey numbers, using some of the upper bounds which we proved in Section \ref{sec:upper_bound}. The section will be based upon \cite{emogrt}[Chapter 2].
\begin{theorem}\label{thm:small_ramsey_numbers}
	$R(3, 4) = 9, R(3, 5) = 14$ and $R(4, 4) = 18$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	by Corollary \ref{cor:upper_bounds_from_ramseys_theorem_even}, we have:
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:R3_4}
		R(3, 4) \leq R(2, 4) + R(3, 3) - 1 = 9
	\end{equation}
	since $R(2, 4) = 4$ and $R(3, 3) = 6$ by Example \ref{exmp:R3_3}. More over by Theorem \ref{thm:ramsey_upper_bound} and Equation \eqref{eq:R3_4} we have:
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:R3_5}
		R(3, 5) \leq R(2, 5) + R(3, 4) \leq 5 + 9 = 14
	\end{equation}
	If we can construct a $2$-edge coloring $\chi: E(K^{*}_{13}) \to \left\{red, blue\right\}$ on $K^{*}_{13}$ with no $red$-clique of order $3$ and no $blue$ clique of order $5$, then we may conclude that $R(3, 5) = 14$ and hence $R(3, 4) = 9$ by Equations \eqref{eq:R3_4} and \eqref{eq:R3_5}. It is in fact the case that we may construct such a $2$-edge coloring $\chi$ on $K^{*}_{13}$ one example of such a coloring is:
	\begin{equation*}
		\chi(\{i, j\}) = \begin{cases}
			red  & \text{ if } [i - j]_{13} \in \left\{1, 5, 8, 12\right\} \\
			blue & \text{ otherwise }
		\end{cases}
	\end{equation*}
	Please note that $\chi$ is well defined since $-1 \equiv 12 \mod 13$ and $-5 \equiv 8 \mod 13$ and hence $[i - j]_{13} \in \left\{1, 5, 8, 12\right\}$ if and only if $[j - i]_{13} \in \left\{1, 5, 8, 12\right\}$. The fact that $\chi$ admits no $red$-monochromatic cliques of order $3$ and no $blue$-monochromatic cliques of order $5$ is checked via the code in Appendix \ref{app:ramsey_code}.
	Additionally since $R(3, 4) = 14$ we have $R(4, 4) \leq R(3, 4) + R(4, 3) = 18$, once again by Theorem \ref{thm:ramsey_upper_bound}, using this inequality we can show that $R(4, 4) = 18$ by constructing a $2$-edge coloring $\gamma: E(K^{*}_{17}) \to \left\{red, blue\right\}$ which admits no $red$ or $blue$ monochromatic cliques of order $4$. One such $2$-edge coloring is given below:
	\begin{equation*}
		\gamma(\left\{i, j\right\}) = \begin{cases}
			red  & \text{ if } [i -  j]_{17} \in \left\{1, 2, 4, 8, 9, 13, 15, 16\right\} \\
			blue & otherwise
		\end{cases}
	\end{equation*}
	again please note that $\gamma$ is well defined, just like $\chi$, by an identical argument. Again the fact that $\gamma$ admits no $red$ or $blue$ monochromatic cliques of order $5$ is checked via the code in Appendix \ref{app:ramsey_code}.
\end{proof}

For the sake of illustration $K^{*}_{13}$ equiped with the $2$-edge coloring $\chi$ and $K^{*}_{17}$ equiped with the $2$-edge coloring $\gamma$, both from the proof of Theorem \ref{thm:small_ramsey_numbers} is illustated below in Figures \ref{fig:small_ramsey_graphs}
\input{main/ramsey/graphs/graphs_for_small_ramsey_numbers}

Before moving on we will need one additional concept, introduced in the following definition:
\begin{definition}\label{def:set_sum_free}
	Let $(G, +)$ be an abelian group, then the subset $S \subseteq G$ is called \textit{sum-free} if the equation $x + y = z$ has no solution in $S$.
\end{definition}

Some parts of the proof of the following Theorem is inspired by \cite{graph_theory}[Exercise 12.3.4]
\begin{theorem}\label{thm:R3_3_3}
	We have $R(3, 3, 3) = 17$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	We start by showing that any $3$-edge coloring $\chi: E(K_{17}) \to \left\{red, blue, green\right\}$ admits a monochromatic clique of order $3$. Let $v \in V(K_{17})$, by the generalized pigeonhole principle (Theorem \ref{thm:gpp}), there exists a color $c \in \left\{red, blue, green\right\}$ such that $\abs{\mathcal{N}_{\chi}(v; c)} \geq 6$. Assume without loss of generalization that $c = red$, then we may assume that $\chi\left(E(K_{17} \vert_{\mathcal{N}_{\chi}(v; c)})\right) = \left\{blue, green\right\}$, otherwise we would have a $red$-monochromatic clique of order $3$. However since $R(3, 3) = 6$, this means that $\chi$ admits either a $blue$ or $green$ monochromatic clique of order $3$.

	Next we will show that $R(3, 3, 3) > 16$, we will do this by constructing a $3$-edge coloring $\gamma$ on the complete graph $K$ with vertex set $\mathbb{Z}_2[X] / \gen{X^4 + X + 1}$\footnote{Which is of course isomorphic to $\mathbb{F}_{16}$, however it will be move convinient for us to work from this polynomial view.}. We will construct $3$ cosets $S_{red}, S_{blue}, S_{green}$ which partition $\mathbb{Z}_2[X] / \gen{X^4 + X + 1}$, and assign a color to the edge $\left\{v, u\right\}$ according to which coset $v + u$ belongs to. To start let:
	\begin{equation*}
		S_{red} := \left\{X^3, X^2 + X^{3}, X + X^{3}, 1 + X + X^2 + X^3 , 1\right\}
	\end{equation*}
	Note that $S_{red}$ is a subgroup of the multiplicative group $(\mathbb{Z}_2[X] / \gen{X^4 + X + 1})^{*}$, additionally we note that $S_{red}$ is sum-free, which is easy albeit cumbersome to check. Similarly we let $A_{blue} := X S_{red}$ and $S_{green} := X^2 S_{red}$, these cosets must also be sum-free since $a + b = c$ with $a, b, c \in S_{blue}$ or $a, b, c \in S_{green}$ would imply:
	\begin{equation*}
		Xa' + Xb' = Xc' \implies a' + b' = c' \text{ with } a', b', c' \in S_{red}
	\end{equation*}
	or
	\begin{equation*}
		X^{2}a' + X^{2}b' = X^{2}c' \implies a' + b' = c' \text{ with } a', b', c' \in S_{red}
	\end{equation*}
	respectively, since $\mathbb{Z}_2[X] / \gen{X^4 + X + 1}$ is a finite field and hence a domain. Define $\gamma(\left\{v, u\right\}) = c$ if and only if $v + u \in S_{c}$, additionally we note that $\gamma$ is well defined as $v \neq u$ and $\Char(\mathbb{Z}_2[X] / \gen{X^4 + X + 1}) = 2$. Assume for the sake of contradiction that $\gamma$ admits a $c$-monochromatic clique of order $3$, that is there exists $u, v, w \in V(K) = \mathbb{Z}_2[X] / \gen{X^4 + X + 1}$ such that $u + v, u + w, v + w \in S_c$, then $u + w = (u + v) + (v + w)$ contradicting the fact that $S_c$ is sum-free.
\end{proof}
