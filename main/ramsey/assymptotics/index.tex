\section{Asymptotic Behaviour of Certain Ramsey Numbers}\label{sec:ass_ramsey}
In this section we will investigate the asymptotic behaviour of certain Ramsey numbers. Starting with $R(\ell; r)$ as $r \to \infty$ and finishing providing an explicit construction using projective planes, which shows that $R(3, \ell) = \Omega(\ell^{3 / 2})$.
