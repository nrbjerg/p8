\chapter{Ramsey Theory}

Before we can get started we will need some basic notions from graph theory.
\begin{definition}
	Let $G = (V, E)$ be a graph, $G$ is called \textit{complete} if $v, u \in V$ such that $v \neq u$ implies $\left\{v, u\right\} \in E$. A \textit{subgraph} of $G$ is a graph $G' = (V', E')$ such that $V' \subseteq V$ and $E' \subseteq E$. Finally a complete subgraph is called a \textit{clique}.
\end{definition}
We often denote a complete graph with $n$ vertices as $K_n$.


\begin{theorem}[Generalized Pigeonhole Principle]\label{thm:gpp}
	Let $A$ be a set such that $\abs{A} > m \cdot r$ if $A = \bigcup_{i = 1}^{r} A_i$, then there exists a $A_j$ such that $\abs{A_j} > m$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	Assume for the sake of contradiction that $\abs{A_j} < m$ for $j = 1, 2, \ldots, r$, then:
	\begin{equation*}
		\abs{A} \leq \sum_{j = 1}^r \abs{A_i} < r \cdot m
	\end{equation*}
	clearly a contradiction.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}
	Let $A$ be a set, a \textit{$r$-coloring} on $A$ is a function $\chi: A \to C$ where $C$ is the set of \textit{colors} and $\abs{C} = r$. The subset $A' \subseteq A$ is called \textit{monochromatic} if $\chi(a) = c$ for all $a \in A$.
\end{definition}
\begin{remark}
	The concrete choice of color set $C$, in our $r$-coloring $\chi: A \to C$, is not really a concern, since given any bijection $\phi$ between $C$ and another color set $C'$ one would obtain a new $r$-coloring $\chi' = \phi \circ \chi$.
	Hence for the sake of simplicity we pick $C = [r]$, unless $r = 2$ or $r = 3$ in which cases we usually let $C = \left\{red, blue\right\}$ or $C = \left\{red, blue, green\right\}$ respectively. Additionally we note that an $r$-coloring $\chi$ on $A$, can be thought of as an partitioning of $A$ into the sets $A_i = \left\{a \in A | \chi(a) = i\right\}$.
\end{remark}

We will primarily be interested in the case where $A$ is the set of edges $E$ of the complete graph $K_n$, in which case we will refer to $\chi$ as an edge coloring on $K_n$.

\begin{definition}
	Let $n$ be a positive natural number we will write $n \to (\ell_1, \ell_2, \ldots, \ell_{r})$ if for every $r$-edge coloring $\chi: E_{n} \to \left\{c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_{r}\right\}$ on $K_n$, there exists an $i \in \left\{1, 2, \ldots, r\right\}$ such that $\chi$ emits a $c_{i}$-monochromatic clique of order $k_{i}$.
\end{definition}
\begin{remark}
	Clearly $k_i \leq k_i'$ and $n \to (k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_{r})$ implies that $n \to (k_1', k_2', \ldots, k_{r}')$
\end{remark}
